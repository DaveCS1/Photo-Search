This is an example project is to show how to use to build a Keras model, export the model to ONNX format, and be used to make prediction by ML.net.

## Requirements
For the Modeling part you need Keras.  To export the model from Keras to ONNX, you need WinMLTools.

For the Inference part you need .NET Core3 SDK preview and .net core 3 runtime.  You need to enable VS to allow for .NET Core3 SDK preview to be used.
